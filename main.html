	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its process.
        It helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is when the input size increases.
        A lower <em>time complexity</em> usually indicates a more <em>efficient</em> algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> defines the total memory or space required by an algorithm to execute.
        It measures how efficiently memory is used and is often expressed using notations such as <em>O(n)</em>.
